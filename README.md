## Key Insights

Accurately predicted the result of 47~54% of all matches in any test dataset.

## Code Quality

Please note that the code in this repository may not be perfectly clean as it was primarily written for personal use during my academic research. I plan to clean it up for improved readability in the near future.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to refactor the code for better readability and maintainability.
